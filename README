PIPE CGI
========
This project demonstrates a proof of concept for a persistent server
that communicates with CGI-BIN client requests and processes HTTP
requests efficiently.

How to use
----------
- Compile the C client:
  $ make

- Start a http server with CGI-BIN support:
  $ busybox -p 8000

- Start the application server:
  $ ./server-example.sh

- Make a request:
  $ curl localhost:8000/cgi-bin/index.cgi
  $ curl -XPOST localhost:8000/cgi-bin/client.sh -d "content=test"

Motivation
----------
CGI (Common Gateway Interface) has well-known limitations, particularly
the overhead of spawning a new process for each request, which affects
performance.

This approach uses a minimal statically compiled client (invoked via the
standard CGI-BIN process) that communicates with a persistent
application server through FIFO (named pipes). The persistent server
handles resource-intensive tasks, improving efficiency and reducing the
overhead typically associated with CGI.
